define affection_test_report = """
When loading the WINTERMUTE program, I prompted [persistent.t6doki] to talk through their feelings about me with me. At beginning affection values, this conversation came across natural & friendly, with minimal romantic undertones.

However, after adjusting the values, [persistent.t6doki] seemed flustered by the same question - presumably, they were in love but weary about openly expressing it.

After raising the affection values further, [persistent.t6doki] seemed to think I was a different person entirely, a 'James' - presumably the late James Golf, whose position here I inherited. This was deeply unsettling, and I'm flagging this for review by Iwan.
