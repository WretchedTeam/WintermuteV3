Due to Wintermute.app not being notarized, Gatekeeper's not gonna allow Wintermute to launch normally. 

To work around this:
1. Open the Terminal in Wintermute's folder.
2. Type the following commands:

```
chmod 755 override-mac-signing.sh  
./override-mac-signing.sh
```

Enter your password for sudo access if you're prompted to.
